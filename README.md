# CheckUp
WDI Project 2 (solo)

## About
CheckUp is a single-page web application that allows users to create secure accounts and get recommendations for what types of health checkups they should be thinking about this year to maintain healthy lives. The data is compiled based on each user's age, gender and pregnancy status. These tips are gathered from HealthFinder.gov's API.

## To Use
To use CheckUp, simply create a valid account or login to your existing account. After signing up, login to review what checkups you should be keeping track of to maintain a healthy life this year. If you've already completed a recommended tip, mark it as done.
