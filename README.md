# CheckUp
WDI Project 2 (solo)

http://checkup-app.herokuapp.com/

## About
CheckUp is a single-page web application, built with Backbone.js, that allows a user to securely sign up for an account and login to receive health tips based on his or her age and gender. A user can mark certain health tips as complete to track yearly checkups and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Data was parsed and rendered via the HealthFinder.gov API. Users and their health progress were collected in a PostgreSQL database using Sequelize on a Node.js server.

## To Use
To use CheckUp, simply create a valid account or login to your existing account. After signing up, login to review what checkups you should be keeping track of to maintain a healthy life this year. If you've already completed a recommended tip, mark it as done.
